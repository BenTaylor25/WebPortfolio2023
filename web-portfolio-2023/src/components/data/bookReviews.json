        "review": "Beartown is a story about a struggling town in Sweden with one of the best junior ice hockey teams in the country. The winners of a national tournament will receive a sum of money that would allow Beartown to open tourist attractions and improve the quality-of-life of the town. Unfortunately, before the finals, the captain of the team does something horrible. The victim has a choice between keeping quite and suffering alone, or reporting the crime and risking the future of the town. The story is told from the perspective of a variety of different characters. This is one of my favourite books, and I recommend it to anyone that isn't easily disturbed by heavy content.",

        "author": "Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths",
        "rating": "8.5/10",
        "review": "Algorithms to Live By offers a number of strategies for approaching the scary problems in life such as when to stop looking, the new vs the familiar, and dealing with insufficient information. For those of us that like to solve as many aspects of our lives as possible, practical strategies are often proposed. Where there exists no feasible solution, justification for when and why to accept chance is given. The authors also threw in some relatable humour at times. Algorithms to Live By is a book that almost anyone can stand to benefit from reading, but you will especially enjoy it if you are mathematically/computationally inclined and interested in Philosophy and Psychology.",
