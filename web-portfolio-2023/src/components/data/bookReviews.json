        "review": "Beartown is a story about a struggling town in Sweden with one of the best junior ice hockey teams in the country. The winners of a national tournament will receive a sum of money that would allow Beartown to open tourist attractions and improve the quality-of-life of the town. Unfortunately, before the finals, the captain of the team does something horrible. The victim has a choice between keeping quite and suffering alone, or reporting the crime and risking the future of the town. The story is told from the perspective of a variety of different characters. This is one of my favourite books, and I recommend it to anyone that isn't easily disturbed by heavy content.",
