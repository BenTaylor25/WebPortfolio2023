        "review": "Dark Souls is a game that has not only touched the hearts of many fans, but has had a genuine impact on their lives as a whole. I am one of many that found the game in a difficult time and learned how to cope as a result. The gameplay is extremely harsh to the new player, which pushes many people away, but plays an essential role of the impact of Dark Souls. The lore is full of mysteries and deception; often the only way of finding answers is through drawing connections and seeing if it adds up.",

        "review": "The world of Mass Effect is as detailed as it is expansive. The plot carries moments of tension, triumph, and tragedy, but it's the characters that really bring this series to life. With 20 companion characters, 15 romance options, and numerous other characters from all over the galaxy combined with the branching dialogue options, there is enough content to justify several playthroughs. I played the legacy versions before Mass Effect Legendary was released, and was very impressed with the upgrades the that the remaster brought.",

        "rating": "6/10",
        "review": "Mass Effect Andromeda was highly anticipated, but poorly received due to a number of technical issues and a lack of expansion. With that said, I believe that Andromeda adds to the Mass Effect series rather than taking away. The story fits well into the original, and I think that a remake would allow the game to thrive. For now, I would only recommend Mass Effect Andromeda to fans of the Mass Effect Series.",

        "rating": "8.5/10",
        "review": "Dishonored has an interesting take on the stealth genre: getting caught does not fail the mission, but excessive aggression has an impact on the world. The level design and world building is incredible; each level has several different paths to choose from, which will show you different characters and interactions. Side missions are optional, but directly play into the main missions. The Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches DLCs tell a story parallel to the base game, and the context added makes the whole package much more valuable.",

        "rating": "7/10",
        "review": "Dishonored 2 takes place 15 years after its predecessor. The sequel is much more visually detailed, the world is more reactive, and there are more gameplay tools available (especially for non-lethal players). The chaos system has been modified so that stealth and aggression are both measured. Unfortunately this is where I think the complements of Dishonored 2 end; I found the storyline to be less captivating than the original, and that the graphical upgrades resulted in the unique style being largely lost. I'm also including Dishonored: Death of the Outsider in this review - largely because of the parallels with the DLC of the first game. I feel conflicted about DotO; on the one hand it answers a lot of questions raised through the series, on the other hand it may have been better for such questions to remain unsolved. Overall I would recommend Dishonored 2 and DotO to fans of the original, though I do not hold the sequel is quite so high regard.",
