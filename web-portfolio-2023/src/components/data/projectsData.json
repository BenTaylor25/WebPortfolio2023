I was also studying Further Maths at the time, where Elastic Collisions in Two Dimensions was a topic that I wanted to get a head start on, so I chose to adopt it into my programming project. It was my first time using C++, and I had to find a suitable graphics / mouse-input library and implement rotation matrix logic in code.",

I offered help where I could, but after seeing some of the same questions from multiple people, I decided to make a Programming tutorial series. I decided to focus on the core concepts, with minimal fancy language-specific tips and tricks. I also showed off small amounts of C++ and Java code for comparison, to make learning a new language later easier.",

I also included a crash-course-style video on applying the concepts from the previous series to the Java language.",
