I was also studying Further Maths at the time, where Elastic Collisions in Two Dimensions was a topic that I wanted to get a head start on, so I chose to adopt it into my programming project. It was my first time using C++, and I had to find a suitable graphics / mouse-input library and implement rotation matrix logic in code.",

One of which was Data Structures and Algorithms - an extremely important topic for problem solving and interviews. I decided to make an interactive visualisation tool to help others on my course. I have since created a YouTube series on Data Structures and Algorithms which uses the application.",
