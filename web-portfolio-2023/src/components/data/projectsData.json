I was also studying Further Maths at the time, where Elastic Collisions in Two Dimensions was a topic that I wanted to get a head start on, so I chose to adopt it into my programming project. It was my first time using C++, and I had to find a suitable graphics / mouse-input library and implement rotation matrix logic in code.",

One of which was Data Structures and Algorithms - an extremely important topic for problem solving and interviews. I decided to make an interactive visualisation tool to help others on my course. I have since created a YouTube series on Data Structures and Algorithms which uses the application.",

I offered help where I could, but after seeing some of the same questions from multiple people, I decided to make a Programming tutorial series. I decided to focus on the core concepts, with minimal fancy language-specific tips and tricks. I also showed off small amounts of C++ and Java code for comparison, to make learning a new language later easier.",

Specifically, I think that Classes and Objects are very hard to describe in a short sentence without an example. I wanted to create a follow-up to my Intro to Programming series to explain each of the core concepts. I also included a crash-course-style video on applying the concepts from the previous series to the Java language.",
